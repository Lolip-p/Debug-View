# ABOUT:
**This shader can be useful for mod, model, and texture pack developers. It supports various modes that display Wireframe, Normal Maps, Depth, PBR, Position, etc. in a single shader, and they all have labels.**

When I first started working with shaders, I didn't quite understand how these modes looked visually during debugging. Therefore, I hope to help beginners assemble a convenient ready-made shader in one place.
